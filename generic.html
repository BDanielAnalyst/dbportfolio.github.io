									<h1>A brief look into<br />
									my work history</h1>
									<p>From warehousing to customer service and Administration<br />
									Understanding the workflow and importance of communication<br />
								</header>
							<p>	I have begun working in the UK in 2013 as a warehouse employee, a start a lot of immmigrants can probably root back to. Accross the next few years I have worked within various deparments within a large complex employing up to 1000 personel at a time.
								 During this period i have gained an understanding and insight into most of the processes and workflow of the whole operation. I'd like to avoid going into too much detail, but in my opinion the most important takeaway from these years was understanding
								how vital it is for multiple departments to work together based on good communication, delegation and resourcing.</p>
							<p>	I have gradually moved into more office based roles, rather than hands on, as i had a good understanding of computers and "behind-the-scene" applications, while still getting on the action hands on from time to time. I think it is beneficial to be able to
								both understand the systems&desings behind a process as well as the practical side of things. I undertook supervisory and HR roles within the same warehouse, where i was able to utilize my operations knowledge to help other colleagues as well as handle HR issues.
								People skills are essential to any workplace, especially in our time, where the scope of diversity and cultural differences have never been more significant than today.
							</p>
							<p>	I have also had multiple roles spanning across customer service and administration, leading up more to the present. In these roles i have learned to further develop my communication and professional relationship skills. I was also on the lookout to optimize 
								work practices where beneficial, and during these times i have grown more and more fond of solutions provided by patterns, automization and analysis.
							</p>
							<p>	Data is relevant in practically any job industry and field, especially in the rapidly developing digital world. It is an incredibly powerful asset to be able to work, analyze and utilize analysis solutions. be it about showing profits, trends, test results and so on.
								I am very interested in delving into these practices and to make a difference, as well as to grow and learn more in the field.
